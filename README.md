## Overview

Bookmark Manager Zero is a Chrome extension that provides a beautiful, feature-rich side panel interface for managing your native Chrome bookmarks. It enhances your bookmark management experience with modern UI, advanced search, safety checking, and intelligent organization tools.

### Why Bookmark Manager Zero?

**The only bookmark manager with integrated security scanning.**

Other bookmark tools make you choose between organization OR security. Bookmark Manager Zero combines both:

## How Link & Safety Checking Works

This section provides technical details on how the extension determines link status and safety for anyone interested in the methodology.

### Link Status Checking

The extension checks if bookmark URLs are still accessible and categorizes them as **Live**, **Dead**, or **Parked**.

#### Detection Method

1. **Initial Domain Check**: The URL's domain is first checked against a list of 22+ known domain parking services:
   - **Registrars**: HugeDomains, GoDaddy, Namecheap, NameSilo, Porkbun, Dynadot, Epik
   - **Marketplaces**: Sedo, Dan.com, Afternic, DomainMarket, Squadhelp, BrandBucket, Undeveloped, Atom
   - **Parking Services**: Bodis, ParkingCrew, Above.com, SedoParking

2. **HTTP HEAD Request**: A lightweight HEAD request is sent with CORS mode to track redirects (10-second timeout)
   - No page content is downloaded
   - Credentials are omitted for privacy
   - Falls back to no-cors mode if CORS is blocked

3. **Redirect Detection**: If the URL redirects to a different domain, the final destination is checked against parking domain lists
   - Example: `example.com` → `hugedomains.com/domain/example.com` = **Parked**
   - Same-site redirects (www, HTTPS) are not flagged

4. **Response Interpretation**:
   - **Successful response** → Live
   - **Redirects to parking domain** → Parked
   - **Timeout/Network Error** → Dead

5. **Fallback Strategy**: If HEAD fails, a GET request is attempted with the same redirect detection logic

#### Rate Limiting
Bookmarks are scanned in batches of 5 with a 1-second delay between batches. This prevents overwhelming your network with too many DNS requests at once.

#### Caching
Results are cached locally for 7 days to minimize network requests.

---

### Safety Checking

The extension checks URLs against multiple threat databases to identify malicious, phishing, or scam websites.

#### Phase 1: Blocklist Lookup (Free, No API Key Required)

URLs are checked against four community-maintained blocklists:

| Source | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **[URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)** | Malware URLs | Database by abuse.ch tracking malware distribution sites |
| **[BlockList Project - Malware](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Malware Domains | Community-maintained malware domain list |
| **[BlockList Project - Phishing](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Phishing Domains | Known phishing sites |
| **[BlockList Project - Scam](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Scam Domains | Known scam websites |

- Blocklists are downloaded and cached locally
- Updated every 24 hours
- Both full URLs and domains are checked
- **Any match → Unsafe** (shows which source flagged it)

#### Phase 2: Google Safe Browsing (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are checked against Google's threat database:

- **Threat Types Checked**: Malware, Social Engineering, Unwanted Software, Potentially Harmful Applications
- **Method**: POST request to Safe Browsing API v4
- **Rate Limit**: 10,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Any match → Unsafe**

#### Phase 3: VirusTotal (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are submitted to VirusTotal's multi-engine scanner:

1. URL is submitted for analysis
2. Results are retrieved after 2 seconds
3. Multiple antivirus engines analyze the URL

**Threat Determination**:
- **2+ engines flag as malicious → Unsafe**
- **1 malicious OR 2+ suspicious → Warning**
- **0 detections → Safe**

**Rate Limit**: 500 requests/day, 4 requests/minute (free tier)

#### Phase 4: Suspicious Pattern Detection

If all above checks pass, the URL is analyzed for suspicious patterns:

| Pattern | Detection | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **HTTP Only (Unencrypted)** | URL uses `http://` and doesn't redirect to HTTPS | Warning |
| **HTTP Only (redirects to HTTPS)** | URL uses `http://` but site redirects to HTTPS | Warning (informational) |
| **URL Shortener** | Domain is bit.ly, tinyurl.com, t.co, etc. (18+ services) | Warning |
| **Suspicious TLD** | Domain ends in .xyz, .top, .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq, .cc, etc. (30+ TLDs) | Warning |
| **IP Address** | URL uses IP address instead of domain name (IPv4 or IPv6) | Warning |

**Note:** Multiple patterns can be detected simultaneously (e.g., HTTP + Suspicious TLD).

#### Final Status Determination

| Check Result | Final Status |
|--------------|--------------|
| Blocklist match | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| Google Safe Browsing match | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| VirusTotal 2+ malicious | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| VirusTotal 1 malicious or 2+ suspicious | **Warning** (yellow shield) |
| Suspicious patterns found | **Warning** (yellow shield) |
| All checks pass | **Safe** (green shield) |

#### Caching & Privacy

- All results are cached locally for 7 days
- Only URLs are sent to external services (no personal data)
- API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- All features can be disabled in settings

### Version Management
The extension version is centralized in `manifest.json`. All JavaScript files read the version using:
```javascript
const APP_VERSION = chrome.runtime.getManifest().version;
```
When updating the version, only `manifest.json` needs to be changed for code references.

### Building
No build process required - pure vanilla JavaScript.

### Reporting Security Issues
Please report security vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues (mark as security issue).

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome:** ✅ Fully supported (Manifest V3)
- **Edge:** ✅ Should work (Chromium-based)
- **Firefox:** ❌ Use [Firefox version](https://github.com/AbsoluteXYZero/Bookmark-Manager-Zero-Firefox)

## Roadmap
