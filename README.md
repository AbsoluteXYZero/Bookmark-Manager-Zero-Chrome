## Overview

Bookmark Manager Zero is a Chrome extension that provides a beautiful, feature-rich sidebar interface for managing your **native Chrome bookmarks**. No cloud sync, no self-hosting, no separate accounts—it works directly with the bookmarks already built into your browser.

Changes sync **bi-directionally and instantly**: any edits made in Bookmark Manager Zero immediately appear in Chrome's native bookmark system, and vice versa. Don't worry about accidental changes—the built-in undo feature lets you quickly restore recently deleted bookmarks.

It enhances your bookmark management experience with modern UI, advanced search, safety checking, and intelligent organization tools while keeping your data exactly where it belongs: in Chrome.

### Why Bookmark Manager Zero?

**The only bookmark manager with integrated security scanning.**

Other bookmark tools make you choose between organization OR security. Bookmark Manager Zero combines both:

## How Link & Safety Checking Works

This section provides technical details on how the extension determines link status and safety for anyone interested in the methodology.

### Link Status Checking

The extension checks if bookmark URLs are still accessible and categorizes them as **Live**, **Dead**, or **Parked**.

#### Detection Method

1. **Initial Domain Check**: The URL's domain is first checked against a list of 22+ known domain parking services:
   - **Registrars**: HugeDomains, GoDaddy, Namecheap, NameSilo, Porkbun, Dynadot, Epik
   - **Marketplaces**: Sedo, Dan.com, Afternic, DomainMarket, Squadhelp, BrandBucket, Undeveloped, Atom
   - **Parking Services**: Bodis, ParkingCrew, Above.com, SedoParking

2. **HTTP HEAD Request**: A lightweight HEAD request is sent with CORS mode to track redirects (10-second timeout)
   - No page content is downloaded
   - Credentials are omitted for privacy
   - Falls back to no-cors mode if CORS is blocked

3. **Redirect Detection**: If the URL redirects to a different domain, the final destination is checked against parking domain lists
   - Example: `example.com` → `hugedomains.com/domain/example.com` = **Parked**
   - Same-site redirects (www, HTTPS) are not flagged

4. **Response Interpretation**:
   - **Successful response** → Live
   - **Redirects to parking domain** → Parked
   - **Timeout/Network Error** → Dead

5. **Fallback Strategy**: If HEAD fails, a GET request is attempted with the same redirect detection logic

#### Rate Limiting
Bookmarks are scanned in batches of 5 with a 1-second delay between batches. This prevents overwhelming your network with too many DNS requests at once.

#### Caching
Results are cached locally for 7 days to minimize network requests.

---

### Safety Checking

The extension checks URLs against multiple threat databases to identify malicious, phishing, or scam websites.

#### Phase 1: Blocklist Lookup (Free, No API Key Required)

URLs are checked against four community-maintained blocklists:

| Source | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **[URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)** | Malware URLs | Database by abuse.ch tracking malware distribution sites |
| **[BlockList Project - Malware](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Malware Domains | Community-maintained malware domain list |
| **[BlockList Project - Phishing](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Phishing Domains | Known phishing sites |
| **[BlockList Project - Scam](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Scam Domains | Known scam websites |

- Blocklists are downloaded and cached locally
- Updated every 24 hours
- Both full URLs and domains are checked
- **Any match → Unsafe** (shows which source flagged it)

#### Phase 2: Google Safe Browsing (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are checked against Google's threat database:

- **Threat Types Checked**: Malware, Social Engineering, Unwanted Software, Potentially Harmful Applications
- **Method**: POST request to Safe Browsing API v4
- **Rate Limit**: 10,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Any match → Unsafe**

#### Phase 3: VirusTotal (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are submitted to VirusTotal's multi-engine scanner:

1. URL is submitted for analysis
2. Results are retrieved after 2 seconds
3. Multiple antivirus engines analyze the URL

**Threat Determination**:
- **2+ engines flag as malicious → Unsafe**
- **1 malicious OR 2+ suspicious → Warning**
- **0 detections → Safe**

**Rate Limit**: 500 requests/day, 4 requests/minute (free tier)

#### Phase 4: Suspicious Pattern Detection

If all above checks pass, the URL is analyzed for suspicious patterns:

| Pattern | Detection | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **HTTP Only (Unencrypted)** | URL uses `http://` and doesn't redirect to HTTPS | Warning |
| **HTTP Only (redirects to HTTPS)** | URL uses `http://` but site redirects to HTTPS | Warning (informational) |
| **URL Shortener** | Domain is bit.ly, tinyurl.com, t.co, etc. (18+ services) | Warning |
| **Suspicious TLD** | Domain ends in .xyz, .top, .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq, .cc, etc. (30+ TLDs) | Warning |
| **IP Address** | URL uses IP address instead of domain name (IPv4 or IPv6) | Warning |

**Note:** Multiple patterns can be detected simultaneously (e.g., HTTP + Suspicious TLD).

#### Final Status Determination

| Check Result | Final Status |
|--------------|--------------|
| Blocklist match | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| Google Safe Browsing match | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| VirusTotal 2+ malicious | **Unsafe** (red shield) |
| VirusTotal 1 malicious or 2+ suspicious | **Warning** (yellow shield) |
| Suspicious patterns found | **Warning** (yellow shield) |
| All checks pass | **Safe** (green shield) |

#### Caching & Privacy

- All results are cached locally for 7 days
- Only URLs are sent to external services (no personal data)
- API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- All features can be disabled in settings

---

### Whitelisting

Users can whitelist specific URLs to:
- Skip safety checks for trusted sites
- Override false positives
- Whitelisted bookmarks display a white shield indicator instead of green
- Add/remove from whitelist via bookmark context menu (right-click)
- Use the "Trusted" filter to view all whitelisted bookmarks
- Whitelist is stored locally and persists across sessions

## Changelog

### v1.7.0 (Current) - Enhanced Theming & Menu Improvements

**New Features:**
- 🎨 **Bookmark Opacity Slider** - Control bookmark background transparency (0-100%) directly from Theme menu
- 🌓 **Theme-Aware Text Inversion** - Intelligent text color inversion that adapts to your theme (dark text on dark themes, light text on light theme)
- ✍️ **Custom Text Color Picker** - Full color customization for bookmark and folder text with visual color picker and reset button

**Improvements:**
- 📐 **Improved Menu Positioning** - All menus (Theme, View, Zoom, Settings) now respect 16px margins from viewport edges
- 🎯 **Enhanced Context Menu** - Bookmark context menus never extend behind toolbar, with better overflow handling
- 📱 **Better Responsive Menus** - Menus scale properly to viewport width with increased margins for cleaner layout
- 🎨 **Reorganized Theme Menu** - Opacity, text inversion, and text color controls now in Theme menu for better organization
- 🎯 **Reduced Font Sizes** - Accent Color and Text Color labels now use matching 11px font size for consistency

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Bookmark Opacity**: Uses CSS `::before` pseudo-element to apply opacity only to the background layer, keeping text and icons at full opacity for better readability. The opacity value is controlled via CSS variable `--bookmark-container-opacity`.
- **Text Inversion**: Theme-aware CSS selectors apply dark text (#1a1a1a) on dark themes and light text (#e8e8e8) on light theme, with text-shadow for enhanced contrast.
- **Text Color**: Targets `.bookmark-title`, `.folder-title`, and `.bookmark-url` elements specifically for precise color control.
