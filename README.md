## Overview

Bookmark Manager Zero is a Chrome extension that provides a beautiful, feature-rich side panel interface for managing your **native Chrome bookmarks**. It works directly with the bookmarks already built into your browser, with optional cloud sync via GitLab Snippets for backup and cross-device synchronization.

Changes sync **bi-directionally and instantly**: any edits made in Bookmark Manager Zero immediately appear in Chrome's native bookmark system, and vice versa. Don't worry about accidental changes—the built-in undo feature and a changelog in the settings let you quickly restore recently deleted renamed, or moved bookmarks and folders.

It enhances your bookmark management experience with modern UI, advanced search, safety checking, and intelligent organization tools while keeping your data exactly where it belongs: in Chrome.

### Why Bookmark Manager Zero?

**The only bookmark manager with integrated security scanning.**

Other bookmark tools make you choose between organization OR security. Bookmark Manager Zero combines both:

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store (Recommended)
Install directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-manager-zero/jbpiddimkkdfhoellbiegdopfpilnclc)

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/AbsoluteXYZero/BMZ-Chrome.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the cloned directory

## Getting Started

Bookmark Manager Zero offers two ways to use the extension:

### Option 1: Native Bookmarks Mode (Default)

- **Works directly with Chrome's built-in bookmarks** - no setup required
- Changes sync **bidirectionally** between extension and native Chrome bookmarks
- No account or cloud sync needed
- Perfect for users who want enhanced bookmark management without GitLab

**Just install and start using!** All features work immediately with your existing Chrome bookmarks.

### Option 2: GitLab Sync Mode (Optional)
Add cloud backup and cross-device synchronization to your bookmarks:

1. **Create a free [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com)** and generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):

   - Navigate to GitLab → Settings → Access Tokens
   - Token name: "Bookmark Manager Zero" (or any name you prefer)
   - Scope required: **`api`** ✅
   - Expiration: Choose your preferred date
   - Click "Create personal access token"
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL**: PATs display only **ONCE** - copy immediately and save to a password manager
   - Track expiration date to avoid sync interruptions

2. **Configure Gitlab integration in the extension**:

   - Click the Gitlab icon in the GUI or open extension settings (gear icon)
   - Paste your token (must start with `glpat-` prefix)
   - Token will be encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
   - Choose to create new Snippet or connect to existing one

3. **Your bookmarks sync automatically**:

   - Changes sync across all your devices via private GitLab Snippets
   - Still works with native Chrome bookmarks (bidirectional sync maintained)
   - Auto-sync every 5 minutes when side panel is open
   - Event-driven sync also triggers on bookmark/folder changes
   - **Important**: Side panel must stay open for background sync to work

**Adding Sync to Existing Bookmarks**

Already using the extension? Add GitLab sync anytime:
1. Click the GitLab icon or settings (gear icon) → GitLab Snippet Sync
2. Enter your GitLab Personal Access Token
3. Choose your setup option:

   - **Create New Snippet** - Start fresh with a new snippet in GitLab
   - **Connect to Existing Snippet** - Link to a snippet you already created
4. **If you have local bookmarks**, you'll see a dialog with 3 options:

   - **Keep Local Bookmarks** - Cancel setup and keep your local bookmarks unchanged
   - **Merge Bookmarks** - Combine your local bookmarks with the snippet (recommended)
   - **Replace with Snippet** - Use only the snippet's bookmarks
     - Safety feature: Option to download backup before replacing
     - Choose "Download Backup & Replace" (recommended) or "Skip Backup & Replace"
5. After connecting, manual sync button options:

   - **Pull** - Download and merge remote bookmarks with local
   - **Push** (auto) - Upload local changes to remote
   - **Force Push** - Overwrite remote completely (Shift+Click sync button)

**Token Tips**

- Any PAT with `api` scope works as long as your GitLab account is in good standing
- The extension includes helpful error prompts to guide you if authentication issues occur
- Keep your token secure - it's encrypted before storage but treat it like a password

### Keyboard Shortcuts

#### Navigation (when item selected)

- `↑/↓` - Navigate bookmarks
- `←/→` - Collapse/expand folders or show/hide previews
- `Enter` - Open bookmark or toggle folder
- `Escape` - Clear selection

## Privacy

Bookmark Manager Zero respects your privacy:

- **All data stored locally** on your device
- **No tracking or analytics**
- **No advertisements**
- **Open source** - audit the code yourself

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for complete privacy policy.

## External Services (Optional)

The extension can optionally use external services for enhanced features. **All can be disabled in settings:**

### Default Services (can be disabled)

- **WordPress mshots** - Website screenshot previews
- **10 Blocklist Sources** - Dual URLhaus coverage (Active + Historical), BlockList Project (Malware/Phishing/Scam), HaGeZi TIF, Phishing-Filter, OISD Big, FMHY Filterlist, Dandelion Sprout Anti-Malware
- **URLVoid** - Multi-source reputation analysis from 30+ security engines
- **Google Favicons** - Website icons

### User-Configured Services (require API keys)

- **Google Safe Browsing** - Additional malware protection (10K requests/day)
- **Yandex Safe Browsing** - Geographic threat diversity (100K requests/day)
- **VirusTotal** - Comprehensive threat scanning from 70+ AV engines (500 requests/day)

All external service usage is disclosed in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

### Important Notice: GitLab API Usage

**How GitLab Snippets Are Used:**

- This extension uses GitLab Snippets as intended by GitLab: for storing structured data
- Your bookmarks are stored in a private Snippet in your own GitLab account
- Snippets are a legitimate GitLab feature designed for storing code, configuration, and structured data
- The extension uses standard GitLab Snippets API endpoints documented in the official GitLab API

**API Usage Considerations:**

- **Event-driven sync**: API calls are made when you add/edit/delete bookmarks or folders
- **Auto-sync polling**: When enabled, checks for remote changes every 5 minutes (when side panel is open)
- **Manual sync**: Use the "Pull from Snippet" and "Push to Snippet" buttons for manual control
- **Side panel requirement**: Side panel must remain open for background sync to work
- **Rate limiting protection**: Built-in exponential backoff with jitter respects GitLab API limits
- **Rate limits**: GitLab has API rate limits; typical bookmark usage stays well within limits

**Best Practices:**

- Keep the side panel open if you want automatic background sync
- Use manual "Snippet Sync button" in the GUI to check for changes from other devices when needed
- The extension automatically syncs when you make changes (add/edit/delete bookmarks)
- For very large collections (>5000 bookmarks), edits will naturally sync less frequently

## How Link & Safety Checking Works

This section provides technical details on how the extension determines link status and safety for anyone interested in the methodology.

### Link Status Checking

The extension checks if bookmark URLs are still accessible and categorizes them as **Live**, **Dead**, or **Parked**.

#### Detection Method

1. **Initial Domain Check**: The URL's domain is first checked against a list of 22+ known domain parking services:

   - **Registrars**: HugeDomains, GoDaddy, Namecheap, NameSilo, Porkbun, Dynadot, Epik
   - **Marketplaces**: Sedo, Dan.com, Afternic, DomainMarket, Squadhelp, BrandBucket, Undeveloped, Atom
   - **Parking Services**: Bodis, ParkingCrew, Above.com, SedoParking

2. **HTTP HEAD Request**: A lightweight HEAD request is sent with CORS mode to track redirects (10-second timeout)

   - No page content is downloaded
   - Credentials are omitted for privacy
   - Falls back to no-cors mode if CORS is blocked

3. **Redirect Detection**: If the URL redirects to a different domain, the final destination is checked against parking domain lists

   - Example: `example.com` → `hugedomains.com/domain/example.com` = **Parked**
   - Same-site redirects (www, HTTPS) are not flagged

4. **Response Interpretation**:

   - **Successful response** → Live
   - **Redirects to parking domain** → Parked
   - **Timeout/Network Error** → Dead

5. **Fallback Strategy**: If HEAD fails, a GET request is attempted with the same redirect detection logic

#### Performance & Rate Limiting

**Optimized Batch Processing:**

- Bookmarks are scanned in batches of 10 with a 100ms delay between batches
- Concurrency limiter enforces maximum 10 concurrent network requests
- Link and safety checks run in parallel for up to 2x faster scanning per bookmark
- Prevents overwhelming your network/router with excessive DNS requests

**Smart Timeout Strategy:**

- Link checks: 5s timeout (HEAD request), 5s timeout (GET fallback)
- Timeout handling: Sites that timeout are marked as 'live' (slow server) instead of 'dead'
- No redundant GET fallback on timeout - saves up to 5s per slow site
- URLVoid scraping: 5s timeout
- VirusTotal API: 8s timeout

**Network Protection:**

- Maximum 10 bookmarks actively scanning at any time (controlled by concurrency limiter)
- With parallel checks, actual concurrent requests can reach up to 20 (10 bookmarks × 2 checks each)
- Batch delay prevents request flooding between bookmark groups
- Balances speed with network stability

**Expected Performance:**

- ~30-50 bookmarks/second throughput (depending on network conditions)
- 1,000 bookmarks: ~30-60 seconds
- 5,000 bookmarks: ~2-5 minutes
- Speed varies based on cache hits, site response times, and network conditions

#### Caching
Results are cached locally for 7 days to minimize network requests.

#### Privileged URLs (Browser Internal Pages)

Certain URL schemes are recognized as browser internal pages and are automatically marked as trusted without scanning:

- `chrome:*` - Chrome internal pages (e.g., `chrome://extensions`, `chrome://settings`)
- `chrome-extension:*` - Extension pages

**Visual Indicators:**

- **Green chain-link icon** with tooltip: "Link Status: Browser internal page"
- **Green shield icon** with tooltip: "Not scanned (trusted browser page)"

These URLs are inherently safe and don't require HTTP status checks or security scanning. Note that `about:*` URLs work normally in Chrome and are scanned like regular URLs.

---

### Safety Checking

The extension checks URLs against multiple threat databases to identify malicious, phishing, or scam websites.

#### Phase 1: Blocklist Lookup (Free, No API Key Required)

URLs are checked against ten community-maintained blocklists with dual URLhaus coverage:

| Source | Type | Description | Entries |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| **[URLhaus (Active)](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)** | Malware URLs | Official abuse.ch list - actively distributing malware (updated every 5 min) | ~107K |
| **[URLhaus (Historical)](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)** | Malware Domains | Historical threats via CDN mirror (updated every 12 hours) | ~37K |
| **[BlockList Project - Malware](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Malware Domains | Community-maintained malware domain list | ~300K |
| **[BlockList Project - Phishing](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Phishing Domains | Known phishing sites | ~214K |
| **[BlockList Project - Scam](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Scam Domains | Known scam websites | ~112K |
| **[HaGeZi TIF](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists)** | Threat Intel Feeds | Comprehensive malware, phishing, and scam domains | 608K |
| **[Phishing-Filter](https://gitlab.com/malware-filter/phishing-filter)** | Phishing URLs | Aggregated phishing database from OpenPhish & PhishTank | ~21K |
| **[OISD Big](https://oisd.nl/)** | Multi-source | Comprehensive blocklist aggregator covering malware, ads, trackers | ~215K |
| **[FMHY Filterlist](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYFilterlist)** | Unsafe Sites | Fake activators, malware distributors, unsafe download sites | ~282 |
| **[Dandelion Sprout Anti-Malware](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt)** | Anti-Malware | Curated malware, scam, and phishing domains | ~5K |

**Total Coverage**: **~1.36M unique malicious domains** after deduplication

**Implementation Details:**

- Blocklists are downloaded and cached locally in IndexedDB
- Updated every 24 hours automatically
- URLhaus Active uses CORS proxy to access official abuse.ch list with full URL context
- URLhaus Historical uses GitHub mirror for redundancy and historical coverage
- OISD Big uses GitHub mirror to avoid CORS restrictions
- Both full URLs and domain:port combinations are checked
- Dual URLhaus sources provide complementary coverage (active threats + historical data)
- Domain-level matching catches malicious IPs even if specific path differs
- **Any match → Unsafe** (tooltip shows all sources that flagged it)
- All scanning continues through every layer to aggregate findings
- Suspicious pattern detection provides additional coverage for IP-based threats

**Trusted Domain Exceptions:**
To prevent false positives, certain well-known trusted platforms are exempted from local blocklist checks (but still scanned by API-based services):

- `archive.org` - Internet Archive
- `*.github.io` - GitHub Pages (all subdomains)
- `*.githubusercontent.com` - GitHub raw content (all subdomains)
- `*.github.com` - GitHub domains (all subdomains)
- `*.gitlab.com` - GitLab domains (all subdomains)
- `*.gitlab.io` - GitLab Pages (all subdomains)
- `docs.google.com` - Google Docs
- `sites.google.com` - Google Sites
- `drive.google.com` - Google Drive

These domains bypass URLhaus and other local blocklists but are still checked by Google Safe Browsing, Yandex, and VirusTotal if API keys are configured.

#### Phase 2: Google Safe Browsing (Optional, Requires API Key)

If configured, URLs are checked against Google's threat database:

- **Threat Types Checked**: Malware, Social Engineering, Unwanted Software, Potentially Harmful Applications
- **Method**: POST request to Safe Browsing API v4
- **Rate Limit**: 10,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Results aggregated** with other findings (doesn't stop scanning)

#### Phase 3: Yandex Safe Browsing (Optional, Requires API Key)

If configured, provides geographic threat diversity:

- **Coverage**: Russian and Eastern European threats
- **Method**: POST request to Yandex Safe Browsing API
- **Rate Limit**: 100,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Results aggregated** with other findings

#### Phase 4: VirusTotal (Optional, Requires API Key)

If configured, URLs are submitted to VirusTotal's multi-engine scanner:

1. URL is submitted for analysis
2. Results are retrieved after 2 seconds
3. 70+ antivirus engines analyze the URL

**Threat Determination**:

- **2+ engines flag as malicious → Unsafe**
- **1 malicious OR 2+ suspicious → Warning**
- **0 detections → Safe**

**Rate Limit**: 500 requests/day, 4 requests/minute (free tier)

#### Phase 5: Suspicious Pattern Detection

The URL is analyzed for suspicious patterns (scanning continues regardless of previous results):

| Pattern | Detection | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **HTTP Only (Unencrypted)** | URL uses `http://` and doesn't redirect to HTTPS | Warning |
| **HTTP Only (redirects to HTTPS)** | URL uses `http://` but site redirects to HTTPS | Warning (informational) |
| **URL Shortener** | Domain is bit.ly, tinyurl.com, t.co, etc. (18+ services) | Warning |
| **Suspicious TLD** | Domain ends in .xyz, .top, .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq, .cc, etc. (30+ TLDs) | Warning |
| **IP Address** | URL uses IP address instead of domain name (IPv4 or IPv6) | Warning |

**Note:** Multiple patterns can be detected simultaneously (e.g., HTTP + Suspicious TLD).

#### Final Status Determination

**Scanning Methodology**: All layers are checked sequentially, and results are aggregated. The extension does NOT stop at the first flag—it continues through all enabled layers to provide comprehensive threat intelligence.

| Check Result | Final Status | Priority |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Blocklist match (any source) | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| Google Safe Browsing match | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| Yandex Safe Browsing match | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| VirusTotal 2+ malicious | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| VirusTotal 1 malicious or 2+ suspicious | **Warning** (yellow shield) | Medium |
| Suspicious patterns found | **Warning** (yellow shield) | Medium |
| All checks pass | **Safe** (green shield) | Normal |

**Multi-Source Attribution**: Tooltips display all sources that flagged a URL (e.g., "Detected by: URLhaus, Google Safe Browsing, Suspicious TLD"). This provides transparency and helps identify false positives.

#### Caching & Privacy

- All results are cached locally for 7 days
- Only URLs are sent to external services (no personal data)
- API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- All features can be disabled in settings

- Skip safety checks for trusted sites
- Override false positives
- Whitelisted bookmarks display a white shield indicator instead of green
