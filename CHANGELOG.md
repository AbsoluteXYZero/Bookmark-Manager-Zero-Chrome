- Fixed context menus sometimes positioning behind header/toolbar
- Fixed menu overflow on narrow viewports
- Improved menu positioning calculations for edge cases

- Fixed text color not affecting bookmark URLs (now applies to URLs in addition to titles and folder names)
- Fixed theme button getting covered by its own menu when viewport space is limited

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Bookmark Opacity**: Uses CSS `::before` pseudo-element to apply opacity only to the background layer, keeping text and icons at full opacity for better readability. The opacity value is controlled via CSS variable `--bookmark-container-opacity`. The :not() selectors prevent conflicts with drag-and-drop indicators.
- **Text Color**: Uses CSS variable `--custom-text-color` that persists across dynamic DOM changes. Targets `.bookmark-title`, `.folder-title`, and `.bookmark-url` elements specifically for precise color control that survives folder expand/collapse operations.
- **Menu Positioning**: Toolbar menus use `positionFixedDropdown()` while context menus use `adjustDropdownPosition()` to ensure proper positioning relative to their trigger elements.
